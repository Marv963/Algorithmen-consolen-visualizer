# Algorithmen consolen visualizer in C#

Welcome!

These summaries have helped me a lot to better understand the theoretical principles of computer science.

I have also developed a console app that shows the functions of the algorithms.

I would be happy if these documents would help you too.

You are also welcome to take a look at [my sorting visualizer project!](https://github.com/Marv963/Sorting-Visualizer)
